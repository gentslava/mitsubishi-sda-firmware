#CONFIGURATION FILE
#==================
#
#Many properties can be stored in a configuration file. The default path to this config file is "/etc/airplay.conf", which
#can be overridden at build time by setting the compile flag AIRPLAY_CONFIG_FILE_PATH. 
#
#The following file formats are supported:
#  - Binary plist: This is the preferred format, as it is the most efficient and full-featured. These files can be created 
#                  and edited on a Mac using XCode. A number of third-party editors also exist. It can also be created and 
#                  edited on the accessory itself using airplayutil: 
#                    airplayutil prefs write -f /etc/airplay.conf <key> <value>
#  - INI: This is a more easily editable text format. The INI file reader works with any line ending format, supports # and ; 
#         comment lines, blank lines, and spaces before and after delimiters (e.g., "name=value" or "name = value"). 
#         Properties specified before any section are treated as global properties (e.g. "model" for the model name of the 
#         accessory). For properties that would normally by nested, such as an array of HID device dictionaries, each 
#         dictionary is specified in its own section and all contiguous sections of the same type are collected into an 
#         array in order. The following is an example file that specifies a default name, model, one HID device for a touch 
#         screen, and one 960x540 pixel display:
#
#           # Default name of the accessory if a name is not specified in the user prefs.
#           name  = ACME Accessory
#
#           # Model of the accessory.
#           model = ACMEAccessory1,1
#
#           # HID device named "Touch Screen" associated with the main screen.
#           [hidDevice "Touch Screen"]
